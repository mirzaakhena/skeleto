In some scenarios, you may want to decouple a primary function from its dependencies on specific secondary functions. This can be accomplished by using function type aliases and dependency injection. Let's explore an example to understand this better.

Consider the following initial code:

```typescript
function secondary01() {}

function secondary02() {}

function primary() {
  // Here we call secondary01
  secondary01();
}
```

In this setup, the `primary` function directly depends on the `secondary01` function. If we want to swap out `secondary01` for `secondary02`, we would have to modify the implementation of `primary`:

```typescript
function secondary01() {}

function secondary02() {}

function primary() {
  // Now we call secondary02
  secondary02();
}
```

To avoid this tight coupling and make our `primary` function more flexible, we can introduce a function type alias. This will allow us to inject different functions into `primary` without modifying its implementation. Here's how we can achieve this:

1. Define a function type alias:

```typescript
type SomeType = () => void;
```

2. Modify the `primary` function to accept a parameter of this type alias:

```typescript
function secondary01() {}

type SomeType = () => void;

function primary(func: SomeType) {
  func();
}

// Now we can call primary with secondary01
primary(secondary01);
```

By passing `secondary01` as an argument to `primary`, we have decoupled `primary` from a specific implementation. This means we can easily change the behavior of `primary` by injecting a different function:

```typescript
function secondary02() {}

// Call primary with secondary02
primary(secondary02);
```

Since the `primary` function now depends on the function type alias `SomeType` instead of a specific function, we can replace the function passed to `primary` without modifying its code. This makes our code more flexible and easier to maintain.

In summary, by using function type aliases and dependency injection, we can decouple functions and achieve greater flexibility in our code. This technique helps in creating more modular and maintainable codebases.
