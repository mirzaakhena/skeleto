## Context

`Context` type is a structured way to pass metadata through functions, ensuring that all necessary information flows along with the function calls. This can be especially useful for logging, tracing, and managing state across a series of function calls.

Here's a more detailed breakdown of the `Context` type and its usage in your scenario:

### Context Type Definition

The `Context` type encapsulates the core metadata that you want to pass through your functions:

```typescript
type Context = {
  data: Record<string, any>; // Flexible storage for any data
  traceId: string; // Unique identifier for request tracing
  date: Date; // Timestamp for when the request started
};
```

1. **data**: This property is a record (or dictionary) where the keys are strings and the values are of any type. You can store various types of data here, such as state information, database transactions, additional log information, etc.
2. **traceId**: This property is a string that serves as a unique identifier, allowing you to trace a series of function calls back to a single request or session. This is particularly useful for debugging and monitoring.

3. **date**: This property is a `Date` object representing the timestamp when the request started. This can help in tracking the duration of the request and for logging purposes.

### Using the Context in Functions

You can use the `Context` type as the first parameter in functions to ensure that the metadata flows along with the function calls. Here's an example of how you might use it:

```typescript
function first(ctx: Context, a: number) {
  console.log(`Trace ID: ${ctx.traceId}`);
  console.log(`Request started at: ${ctx.date.toISOString()}`);
  console.log(`Data:`, ctx.data);
  console.log(`Parameter a: ${a}`);

  // Perform some operations with the context
  // For example, modify the context data
  ctx.data.someState = `Value derived from ${a}`;

  // Call another function, passing the context along
  second(ctx, a * 2);
}

function second(ctx: Context, b: number) {
  console.log(`Trace ID: ${ctx.traceId} (in second function)`);
  console.log(`Data:`, ctx.data);
  console.log(`Parameter b: ${b}`);
}

// Example usage:
const initialContext: Context = {
  data: {},
  traceId: "12345",
  date: new Date(),
};

first(initialContext, 42);
```

### Example Explanation

1. **first function**:

   - Takes a `Context` object (`ctx`) and a number (`a`) as parameters.
   - Logs the `traceId`, `date`, and `data` from the context.
   - Modifies the `data` property of the context.
   - Calls another function (`second`), passing the modified context and a new parameter.

2. **second function**:

   - Takes a `Context` object (`ctx`) and a number (`b`) as parameters.
   - Logs the `traceId` and `data` from the context.
   - This function can further utilize or modify the context as needed.

3. **Example usage**:
   - An initial context is created with `data`, `traceId`, and `date` properties.
   - The `first` function is called with this initial context and a number.

By passing the `Context` object through your functions, you maintain a consistent way to handle metadata, which can be very helpful for debugging, tracing, and managing state throughout your application.
